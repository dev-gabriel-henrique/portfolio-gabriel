    "title": "About me",
    "p1": "I'm a front-end developer focused on clean, strongly typed, high-performance code built to scale without becoming a future headache. I enjoy building interfaces that make sense to users, but above all, well-structured systems. I like solving real problems, thinking about front-end architecture, avoiding hacks, and keeping the code easy to maintain for whoever comes next — including my future self.",
    "p2": "I have experience working on e-commerce, ERP, CRM, and SaaS projects, from building interfaces to handling more complex integrations. Throughout these experiences, I developed features such as real-time product validation systems using barcode scanners and WebSocket communication, ensuring immediate POS blocking in case of errors, as well as notification systems using Flutter and Firebase. Currently, I work as a <strong>Mid-Level Front-End Developer</strong> at <strong>NX Multiserviços</strong>, contributing to solutions for companies across different industries. Beyond development, I support the front-end team daily and act as a bridge with the back-end to ensure more aligned, efficient, and well-integrated deliveries.",
    "p3": "Outside of work, I enjoy studying psychology-related topics, keeping a consistent workout routine with good music, and going out with my wife to explore local cuisine. When I have some free time, I'm usually at home testing ideas and experimenting with new technologies."
